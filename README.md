# javafx-calculator

- Create JavaFx application from the JavaFx IntelliJ template (use JDK 21)
- You will get some HelloWorld code already available out of the template
- You need to modify that code to create simple calculator
- Your application window as a minimum needs to have two TextFileds (to enter arguments), 4 Buttons (operations) and one TextField at the bottom for result
- All the buttons should have corresponding methods in the controller class which should hadle the operation
- Methods logic should be something like this:
    - Read values from arguments TextFields
    - Cast them to some number type (Integer, Float, Double...)
    - Do the operation
    - Set the result to result TextField
